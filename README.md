FingerIn SignIn and Out system is based on web server and its working with Arduino Uno Wi-Fi to comunicate with the system. 
My idea is to create an application which can be used from big companies to track their employees, subcontractors or visitors. 
The system will automaticly save time in and out and calculate working hours for each person. Also, live statistic will be 
available at any time plus reports for each person will be send by email automaticly at the end of the week. 

Inspiared from the construction site idustry I decided to build this project which will give many companies the opportunity to have
sign in and out system which is web based and can be control online. 

The database structure at the moment is:
Database name | Database tables
--------------|--------------
**fingerprint** | **users**
